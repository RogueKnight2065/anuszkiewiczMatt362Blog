### HW0: Introduction

My name is Matt Anuszkiewicz. I am a computer science student at the College of Charleston.

This blog is about my CSCI 362 Software Engineering course. 


### HW1: Chapter 1

**1.3.** What are four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four other attributes that may sometimes be significant.
    
    - Acceptability
    - Dependability and Security
    - Efficiency
    - Maintainability
    
    - Heterogeneity
    - Able to adapt to changing social and business needs 
    - Security and trust
    - Scale
    
**1.8.** Discuss whether professional engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors and lawyers.

   Professional engineers should be licensed because some if not all the technology they make could have the possibility of killing or effecting human society in some way.

**1.9.** For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause. 
    
    - Public: Shall act with public interest in mind.
    - Client and Employer: Shall act in a manner that holds the interests of the client, employer, and public.
    - Product: Shall ensure that the product is high quality and can be modified.
    - Judgement: Shall maintain integrity and independence of their judgement. 
    - Management: Leaders shall promote ethical practices and manage software development and maintain.
    - Profession: Shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession with public interest.
    - Colleagues: Shall be fair to and support colleagues of all ranks.
    - Self: Shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of the profession. 
    

**1.10.** To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.

   It is understandable that most countries would consider making computer systems to track and analyze citizens of their own country. The amount of intelligence needed to track down and eliminate the threat of terrorism is extremely large, cumbersome, and extremely complex. The issue is that most objectives of terrorism is to cause as much havac as possible and to strike fear in a specific group of people. The other issue is that terrorism is not a uniform casue, anyone could be a terrorist. However invading the privacy of everyone to see if they are a terrorist is extremely invasive and can cause worse consiquenses. Tracking movements is fine even if the data is streaming though military satilites like GPS but tracking habbits and puchuses without a warrent is illigel inside the U.S and we should hold other countries accountable. Now a day most people give the world their info so they are easy to track, but tracking everything they do without a warrent is unethical.

### HW3: Chapter 10

**10.6.** Explain why it is reasonable to assume that the use of dependable processes will lead to the creation of dependable software?



**10.10.** It been suggested that the need for regulation inhibits innovation and that regulators force the use of older methods of systems development that have been used on other systems. Disscudd weather or not you think this is true and the desirability of regulators imposing their views on what methods should be used.
